<!-- # About -->

<p style="text-align: justify; padding-right: 10px;">
Currently, I split my time between the <a href="https://www.mn.uio.no/math/english/">Departement of Mathematics</a> at The University of Oslo, and the  <a href="https://www.oden.utexas.edu">Oden Institute</a> at the University of Texas at Austin. At the Oden Institute, I am a research associate in the <a href="https://www.oden.utexas.edu/research/centers-groups/chg/">Computational Hydraulics Group</a> at led by <a href="https://www.oden.utexas.edu/people/36/">Clint Dawson</a>. At The University of Oslo, I am a postdoc funded by my  individual Marie Sk≈Çodowska-Curie Actions project working with <a href="https://kent-and.github.io">Kent-Andre Mardal</a>. Starting January 2023 I will be an Associate Professor of Scientific Computing at the Norwegian University of Life Science <a href="https://www.nmbu.no/fakultet/realtek/om/institutter/datavitenskap">Department of Data Science</a>.
I previously attended the South Dakota School of Mines and Technology where I earned my Ph.D. in mechanical engineering supervised by <a href="https://www.sdsmt.edu/Directories/Personnel/Romkes,-Albert/">Albert Romkes</a>.

My work is in the development of finite element methods for PDEs where classical finite element methods typically fail to produce acceptable approximations. Currently, my focus is within the context of flood modeling (e.g., hurricane storm surge and riverine flooding) as well as modeling for hydropower applications.
