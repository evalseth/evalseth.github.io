<!-- # About -->

<p style="text-align: justify; padding-right: 10px;">
I am currently a postdoctoral fellow in the <a href="https://www.oden.utexas.edu/research/centers-groups/chg/">Computational Hydraulics Group</a> at the <a href="https://www.oden.utexas.edu">Oden Institute</a> at the University of Texas at Austin.
My work is supervised by <a href="https://www.oden.utexas.edu/people/36/">Clint Dawson</a>.
I previously attended the South Dakota School of Mines and Technology where I earned my Ph.D. in mechanical engineering supervised by <a href="https://www.sdsmt.edu/Directories/Personnel/Romkes,-Albert/">Albert Romkes</a>.

<p style="text-align: justify">
My work is in the development of finite element methods for PDEs where classical finite element methods typically fail to produce acceptable approximations. Currently, my focus is within the context of hurricane storm surge modeling
