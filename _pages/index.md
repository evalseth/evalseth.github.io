<!-- # About -->

<p style="text-align: justify; padding-right: 10px;">
Currently, I am an Associate Professor of Scientific Computing at the Norwegian University of Life Science (NMBU) <a href="https://www.nmbu.no/fakultet/realtek/om/institutter/datavitenskap">Department of Data Science</a> as well as a research associate at the  <a href="https://www.oden.utexas.edu">Oden Institute</a> at the University of Texas at Austin, and an affiliated researcher at Simula Research Laboratory <a href="https://www.simula.no/research/projects/department-numerical-analysis-and-scientific-computing">Department of Numerical Analysis and Scientific Computing</a>. Prior to joining NMBU and Simula, I was also a postdoc funded by an individual Marie Sk≈Çodowska-Curie Actions project working with <a href="https://kent-and.github.io">Kent-Andre Mardal</a>. 
I attended the South Dakota School of Mines and Technology where I earned my Ph.D. in mechanical engineering supervised by <a href="https://www.sdsmt.edu/Directories/Personnel/Romkes,-Albert/">Albert Romkes</a>.

My work is in the development of finite element methods for PDEs where classical finite element methods typically fail to produce acceptable approximations. Currently, my focus is within the context of flood modeling (e.g., hurricane storm surge and riverine flooding) as well as modeling for hydropower applications.
